# React.js : Drag & Drop

- [React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [Starter Kit](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html)

## Reference

The reference example uses CoffeeScript and lodash... So I removed that and left it as JavaScript and React.

I also updated the lib to React 0.12.1 and cleaned up the many 'undefined' classes being added all over the place.
Apparently, coffeeScript likes using `void 0` instead of a simple emply string, which then came through as an `undefined` class name.
